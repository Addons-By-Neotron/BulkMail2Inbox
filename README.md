# BulkMail-Inbox
Bulk mail reception made really easy

# Addon Description

Bulk mail reception made really easy. This addon allows you to selectively pick mails to open from the inbox, open all mails with money or open all items.

# Key Features

There are many bulk email openers available to choose from. However Bulk Mail Inbox has several unique features:

*    Shows a dialog with all items and money in your mailbox.
*    Allows you to take individual items even if they were all sent in one email.
*    You can mark multiple items to take without taking all.
*    Allows easy comparison of items in the mail list with items you're currently using (just hold shift down while hovering the items).
*    Inbox pagination and filtering.
*    Clicking on a column header now sorts that header. Before clicking on any header just rotated the sorting to a new column.
*    Sorting is reversed if you click on the header which currently is sorted.
*    Better placement of the tooltip (now sits next to the frame that opened it)
*    Pressing and releasing the shift key while hovering an item will now properly show/hide the comparison window.
*    Fixed opening of mails is now throttled to prevent errors and as a result opening a lot of mails is now much better.
*    The list of items is updated during auto opening emails.
